# Project specification

## Should contain the following:

- What data structures and algorithms will you be using
- What problem are you solving and why did you chose these specific data structures and algorithms
- What is the program input and how will it be used
- Expected time and space complexities of the program (big-O notations)
- Sources
- Due to administrative practicalities you should also mention your degree programme in the Project Specification. For example, bachelor’s in computer science (CS) or bachelor’s in science (bSc)
- You should also mention the documentation language you are going to use and have all code, comments and documentation written in this language. Typically Finnish or English. This requirement is due to the code reviews done around the half way point of the course. This hopefully helps keep the internal language of the project consistent.
- The specification document is a tool to be used in the beginning of the course that need not be updated during the course unless the course staff explicitly ask for specifications. 
- Note that the assistant has approved the project topic based on the specification document. As such a final submitted project that does not cover the specification document will most likely not be sufficient for passing the course.
