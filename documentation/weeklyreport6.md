# Weekly report 6
This week has been dedicated to making the binary search work. I had some difficulties trying to sort the files in a directory in such an order that my algorithm would be able to return the expected result. I finally managed, I think, by implementing a custom comparator to handle situations where file names might begin the same, but the other one might contain numbers after as well (i.e., comparing names `thisisaname_private_key_txt` and `thisisaname500_private_key_txt`). If I was comparing just the username parts, the default array sorting would work, but because the file names contain other characters as well, the order is thrown off and the result of `Arrays.sort` is not what I want (i.e., I want `thisisaname` to come before `thisisaname500`). This was quite a frustrating task that required a nice amount of `System.out.println`, but it should work as intended now!

I also added a simple functionality that copies the encrypted message to the clipboard. It makes the life of the user a bit easier, because they don't have to copy the encryption result from the command line manually.

NOTE TO SELF: there is still a bug in the binary search algorithm! For example, file name reettaylitalo starts with reetta, which results in the keys of user reetta to be returned. This needs to be fixed.
