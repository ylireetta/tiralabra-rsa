# Weekly report 5
I haven't had much time to work on this project this week, which is why the peer review process and the improvement possibilities it provided was greatly appreciated. The report and the screenshots provided by the person who reviewed my project were excellent, and led me to discover a bug in my code! It was a bit of a hassle to fix it, but I think I managed in the end. I also realized that I had neglected to test a couple of methods in the `FileHelper` class, because JaCoCo highlights the lines green if a call to another method results in the line being executed. I wrote a couple of new tests for `FileHelper`, but I still need to make sure that the code in other classes is thoroughly tested, as well.

All in all, the peer review process was very helpful. It made me look at the material I have created through a different lens, and I think e.g. the updated instructions on how to run the program are clearer now after the peer review. It also forced me to take a closer look at the different commands used with Maven and what they actually do.
